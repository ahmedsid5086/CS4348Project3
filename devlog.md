# Thoughts So Far
I know this project involves building an interactive program to create and manage index files using a B-Tree structure. I am planning on creating this project using python for its simplicity and built-in big-endian support.

# Plan for This Session
- Initialize the Git repository.
- Create a basic project structure with placeholder files.
- Write the `create` and `open` commands as a starting point.

- Implemented and tested `create` and `open` commands.
- Learned how to handle binary file headers in Python.
- Next Steps: Implement `insert` and `search` commands.
