## Thoughts So Far
I know this project involves building an interactive program to create and manage index files using a B-Tree structure. I am planning on creating this project using python for its simplicity and built-in big-endian support.

## Plan for This Session
- Initialize the Git repository.
- Create a basic project structure with placeholder files.
- Write the `create` and `open` commands as a starting point.
